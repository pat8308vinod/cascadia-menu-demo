            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Established in 2003, Beta Lambda Lambda is Cascadia College’s chapter of the national
                Phi Theta Kappa (PTK) Honor Society. The mission of Phi Theta Kappa is to recognize
                academic achievement of college students and to provide opportunities for them to
                grow as scholars and leaders. We welcome approximately 100 new members each year from
                a variety of academic programs. Our Beta Lambda Lambda chapter provides opportunities
                for our members to connect to the greater campus community through a variety of projects.</p>
            <h2>Eligibility Requirements</h2>
            <p>Students are eligible for PTK membership once they have completed 12 credits at Cascadia
                College (defined as courses numbered 100 level and above) and earn a 3.5 GPA or higher.
                PTK membership is available to running start, career-tech, and international students.
                Invitations are sent quarterly to students from the Office of Student Life. These
                invitations include a unique password to join PTK through the <a title="Phi Theta Kappa"
                    href="https://www.ptk.org/">PTK website</a> and require a $75 lifetime membership fee.</p>
            <h2>Scholarships</h2>
            <p>The are two different kinds of scholarships available with PTK membership. Which scholarships
                are right for you will require you to do some research. You can find more details
                on Phi Theta Kappa’s <a title="Phi Theta Kappa Scholarships"
                    href="https://www.ptk.org/scholarships/">scholarship</a> page. </p>
            <h3>Scholarships Offered Through PTK and Its Sponsors</h3>
            <p>These are competitive scholarship awards that you can apply for at any stage in your
                education. You can use the money for your tuition and fees at Cascadia. Scholarships
                are offered for a variety of student populations, including dual-enrollment (Running
                Start) students, career-tech students, international students, and students pursuing
                particular fields of study. These scholarship applications are reviewed twice per
                year, with application deadlines in December and May.</p>
            <h3>Scholarships Offered Through 4-year Universities for Transfer Students</h3>
            <p>If you are transferring from Cascadia to a 4-year school to complete a Bachelor’s
                degree, these scholarships would be part of the financial aid package the admissions
                office at your 4-year school may offer you. Because PTK membership indicates a student
                has strong academic ability, 4-year schools hoping to attract top-tier transfer students
                often offer these scholarships as an incentive for PTK members to apply to their university.
                Check with the universities you are considering to see if they offer a scholarship
                for PTK members.</p>
            <h2>FAQs</h2>
            <h3>Q: Is this spam?</h3>
            <p>A: No, this is not spam. Phi Theta Kappa was founded in 1918 and has nearly 3 million
                members worldwide.</p>
            <h3>Q: Is Phi Theta Kappa a student club?</h3>
            <p>A: No. Phi Theta Kappa is a membership organization that is only open to students
                by invitation, and which requires a one-time membership fee of $75 to join. The national
                PTK organization partners with 2-year colleges to support student scholarship and
                community service on campuses across the country. Through the partnership with the
                PTK organization, students are eligible to hold leadership positions here at Cascadia
                to provide these community service opportunities to their fellow PTK members.</p>
            <p>Student clubs, on the other hand, are open to all students, do not require a membership
                fee, and are initiated and run by Cascadia students. Phi Theta Kappa does not receive
                funding from Cascadia’s Services and Activities Fee.</p>
            <h3>Q: Is Phi Theta Kappa a fraternity or sorority?</h3>
            <p>A: No. It is an academic honor society. The Greek letters are just part of a tradition
                for collegiate membership organizations.</p>
            <h3>Q: Can I join later? Is this a one-time offer?</h3>
            <p>A: As long as you continue to maintain a cumulative GPA of 3.5 or higher, you will
                remain eligible to join PTK. We send out invitations three times per year: Fall, Winter,
                and Spring Quarters. Eligibility is based on your GPA at the end of the prior quarter
                in which you were enrolled. Once issued, the invitation is open for the duration of
                the current quarter in which you were invited.</p>
            <h3>Q: What does Cascadia’s Phi Theta Kappa chapter do?</h3>
            <p>A: That is up to you! Nothing is <em>required</em> on your part as a member. You do not have to attend
                meetings or participate in community
                service. However, PTK offers excellent opportunities to grow in leadership, academic
                research, and service through its various national programs like the Five-Star Chapter
                Plan, the Honors in Action Project competition, and both regional and national leadership
                conferences. If you want to get more involved, talk to Cascadia’s chapter advisor
                about how to do so.</p>
            <h3>Q: What happens if your GPA drops after joining?</h3>
            <p>A: Cascadia College requires a cumulative GPA of 3.5 to maintain active member status.
                If a PTK member’s GPA falls below this required GPA, they would have a one quarter
                probationary period to raise their GPA. If a PTK member is unable to raise their GPA
                after this probationary period, the member will be reduced to inactive status and
                be unable to participate in any PTK events or access any benefits until they are able
                to meet the required GPA requirements.</p>
            <h3>Q: What happens when you join?</h3>
            <p>A: Once a student joins PTK, they will receive a certificate, a PTK pin, and membership
                card. Members should consider becoming active in the chapter in order to gain the
                most from being a part of this prestigious international honor society. Membership
                in PTK is lifelong, meaning that once you graduate from Cascadia College, you will
                become an Alumni and can participate in Alumni activities.</p>
            <h3>Q: Do PTK members wear anything special at graduation?</h3>
            <p>A: Phi Theta Kappa offers a variety of graduation accessories for its members including
                tassels, stoles, and honor cords. You can purchase these accessories from the <a
                    title="Phi Theta Kappa Store" href="https://portal.ptk.org/Store.aspx">PTK virtual store</a>. For

                    different club levels</a> with slightly different criteria and privileges. Clubs have the ability to
                choose
                their club level depending upon the extent of involvement and activities they would
                like to lead.</p>
            <p>To apply for recognition as a new club, fill out the Club Application for Recognition
                form. New clubs are recognized every 2 weeks during the Club Council meeting. Clubs
                can begin to be recognized at the start of Fall quarter and throughout the academic
                year.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Find three to five (3-5) currently enrolled Cascadia students who share your interest
                    in starting the club. Level 1 Clubs must have a minimum of three (3) members to start,
                    and Level 2 Clubs must have a minimum of five (5) club members. There is no maximum
                    number of members for either club level.</li>
                <li>If you wish to be a Level 2 Club, find a Cascadia College employee who is willing
                    to advise your club, travel with your club, and attend club meetings and events. Club
                    Advisors are required for Level 2 Clubs, but are optional for Level 1 Clubs.</li>

                                    <p>An advisor can provide critical guidance, structure, accountability, and
                                        oversight
                                        for a Cascadia club. Many of our students who start and join clubs have big
                                        ideas
                                        and ambitions, but little experience navigating campus policies and processes,
                                        organizing
                                        teams and tasks, running meetings, and/or planning programs. The Student Life

                                        supports and oversees all of Cascadia’s clubs, but a faculty/staff advisor who
                                        is
                                        consistently dedicated to a single club can make a significant difference in the
                                        students’
                                        individual learning as well as in the group’s ability to function, to grow, and

                                    <h4>Who can be a Club Advisor?</h4>
                                    <p>Any Cascadia College employee can serve as a volunteer advisor to a student club
                                        with
                                        their supervisor’s approval. The Student Life Advisor will confirm the Club’s
                                        Advisor
                                        interest and availability.</p>
                                    <h4>What does it mean to be a Club Advisor?</h4>
                                    <p>An effective advisor means building relationships with student leaders and
                                        developing
                                        a style that matches the club’s needs. It is important to keep in mind the
                                        purpose
                                        of the club, the types of interests and identities that unite them, and how you
                                        can
                                        help them to both learn about themselves and educate the campus community
                                        through
                                        engagement with those interests and identities. Some groups will need more or
                                        less
                                        attention depending on the group and the time of year. Clarify with the club
                                        leaders
                                        the time and attention they need from you before you agree to be their advisor.
                                        Taking
                                        an active role in the club (attending meetings, events, meeting with officers,
                                        giving
                                        advice) does not mean that you are running the club. The daily operations of the
                                        club
                                        should remain the responsibility of the officers/club members, not the Club
                                        Advisor.
                                        The main objective of an advisor is to be available to guide and assist the
                                        officers
                                        or members in the mission and goals of the club.</p>

           <h2>What EAB Does</h2>
           <p>The Cascadia Events &amp; Advocacy Board (EAB) is a group of student leaders who plan
              events and advocate for Cascadia College students and community. EAB is committed
              to social justice, sustainability, and creating inclusive events for all Cascadia
              students. Coordinators on EAB work together to provide social, cultural, educational
              and advocacy work through campus programming and outreach to Cascadia students.</p>

           <p><strong>Name:</strong> Miriam Alhassani (She/Her)</p>
           <p><strong>Position:</strong> Programming Chair</p>
           <p><strong>High School you graduated from (and city):</strong> I graduated from Insight School of Washington, located in Tacoma.</p>
           <p><strong>Why did you choose to attend Cascadia?</strong> At first, it was for running start, but I stayed because of how welcoming Cascadia
              is and how they get you to feel like you are a part of a community that is here to
              support you!</p>
           <p><strong>What advice would you give a new student?</strong> If I could give any advice, it would be to advocate for your needs on campus. There
              are always listening ears and to get involved in clubs! Cascadia offers a variety
              of things to do, so do not be afraid to explore around.</p>
           <p><strong>What are your plans after Cascadia?</strong> After Cascadia, I plan on transferring to UW or UWB to earn my bachelor's degree
              in business.</p>
           <p><strong>What are your hobbies/interests?</strong> Currently, I like exploring many different cafes, I am also getting into writing,
              and am getting back into working out. I also am a huge book worm at times but most
              of the time, I’ll be watching something on Netflix.</p>
           <p><strong>If you could be a superhero, what would your superpower be?</strong> I would say Deadpool. Deadpool uses the approach of not coming off as intimidating
              but rather someone who uses humor to connect with others, which is what I’m a huge
              fan of.</p>
           <p><strong>What are some of your favorite snacks?</strong> Honestly, I like to rotate with snacks and try something new from a variety of cultures!</p>

           <p><strong>Name:</strong> Miyuki Sandoval (She/Her)</p>
           <p><strong>Position:</strong> Advocacy Chair</p>
           <p><strong>High School you graduated from (and city):</strong> I graduated from Henry M. Jackson High School in Mill Creek, WA.</p>
           <p><strong>Why did you choose to attend Cascadia?</strong> I chose Cascadia because it was close to home, and I had a lot of friends attend
              in the past. I heard a lot about the Cascadia community and what it could offer, so
              I thought it would be the best choice for me!</p>
           <p><strong>What advice would you give a new student?</strong> Stay in the loop and get involved with the Cascadia community! There are so many
              opportunities on campus to get connected such as clubs, committees, and Student Life
              positions. I would also recommend attending any events we host on campus to meet some
              new people.</p>
           <p><strong>What are your plans after Cascadia?</strong> I am currently looking at transferring to a four-year university.</p>
           <p><strong>What are your hobbies/interests?</strong> In my free time I love to read (currently Kafka has been my go-to) and watch all
              types of movies and TV shows. I also like to eat out with my friends and go on boba
              runs!</p>
           <p><strong>If you could be a superhero, what would your superpower be?</strong> If I were to choose any superpower I would love to be able to time travel! I think
              it would be super cool to be able to see all parts of the world and their history
              without losing any experiences in my present life.</p>
           <p><strong>What are some of your favorite snacks?</strong> I love mangoes, Twix, rice and seaweed, and Wheat Thins.</p>

           <p><strong>Name:</strong> Brandon Lai (He/Him)</p>
           <p><strong>Position:</strong> EAB Event Coordinator</p>
           <p><strong>High School you graduated from (and city):</strong> Mountlake Terrace High School in Mountlake Terrace, WA.</p>
           <p><strong>Why did you choose to attend Cascadia?</strong> I chose to attend Cascadia as I thought it would be a good school to go into running
              start as it has resources and connections with the UW’s. I also thought the location
              was peaceful since this campus is located in a cozy, secluded spot away from the craziness
              of life.</p>
           <p><strong>What advice would you give a new student?</strong> Go talk to other students at Cascadia and you will feel more connected to the community.
              Join clubs, sport activities, and try to hang around the campus to meet new people
              instead of going straight home after your classes finish.</p>
           <p><strong>What are your plans after Cascadia?</strong> I plan to transfer to a four-year and get a degree in Computer Science.</p>
           <p><strong>What are your hobbies/interests?</strong> I enjoy chess, ice-skating, ping-pong, reading, music, and meeting new people.</p>
           <p><strong>If you could be a superhero, what would your superpower be?</strong> I would want the superpower of time-traveling so that I could fix past mistakes or
              see what life is like in the past and future.</p>
           <p><strong>What are some of your favorite snacks?</strong> My favorite snack is probably Nori Maki because it is has a nice crunch and is quite
              savory.</p>

           <p><strong>Name:</strong> Veronica Martinez (She/Her)</p>
           <p><strong>Position:</strong> EAB Event Coordinator</p>
           <p><strong>High School you graduated from (and city):</strong> I go to Redmond High School</p>
           <p><strong>Why did you choose to attend Cascadia?</strong> Many factors went into my decision to attend Cascadia College. I originally wanted
              to attend Cascadia because my brother did running start here;he told me he enjoyed
              the professors and the quality of the classes. Once I looked around campus and saw
              the events they held and the resources/opportunities they provided for their students,
              I knew it would be the place for me.</p>
           <p><strong>What advice would you give a new student?</strong> A piece of advice I would give to incoming Cascadia students is to step out of their
              comfort zones and put themselves out there. Students are given numerous ways to meet
              new people and create a sense of community. All they need to do is go for it!</p>
           <p><strong>What are your plans after Cascadia?</strong> After Cascadia, I am hoping to transfer over to UW Bothell to pursue Computer Science.
              My ultimate goal is to eventually work in cybersecurity!</p>
           <p><strong>What are your hobbies/interests?</strong> Some of my favorite pastimes are reading murder mystery/thriller books, watching
              Formula 1, spending time with friends and family, and listening to music.</p>
           <p><strong>If you could be a superhero, what would your superpower be?</strong> If I were a superhero, I would want my superpower to be invisibility.I think it would
              be cool to be able to disappear and reappear whenever I want to. It would also be
              really fun to scare my friends.</p>
           <p><strong>What are some of your favorite snacks?</strong> I love snacking on anything and everything! My favorite snacks at the moment would
              probably be Oreos and M&amp;M’s.</p>

           <p><strong>High School you graduated from (and city):</strong> I graduated from high school in Korea.</p>
           <p><strong>Why did you choose to attend Cascadia?</strong> I was looking for a college to transfer to universityand Cascadia was the best option
              for me. As an international student, I want to be comfortable speaking English, and
              I want to experience American culture. Cascadia has a lot of opportunities for me
              to enjoy myself!</p>
           <p><strong>What advice would you give a new student?</strong> Participate in Student Life as much as you can, and your Cascadia life will be fun!
              Last quarter I came to campus for classand just went back home after, it was boring.
              I decided to attend various events provided by Student Life and I got to enjoy my
              school life.</p>
